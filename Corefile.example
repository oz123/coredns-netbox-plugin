# The following has all zones handled by both netbox and hosts with
# hosts set to "fallthrough" to the next plugin if it is unable to
# handle the request.
#
# This example highlights the importance of ordering of plugins in
# plugins.cfg during the compilation of CoreDNS.
#
# In the case where netbox was added before hosts requests will be handled
# by netbox exclusively and never by hosts, as netbox not set to fallthrough.
#
# Alternatively if netbox was added after hosts then requests that are not
# answered by hosts will fallthrough to netbox.
