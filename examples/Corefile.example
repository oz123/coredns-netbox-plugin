# The following has all zones handled by both netbox and hosts with
# hosts set to "fallthrough" to the next plugin if it is unable to
# handle the request.
#
# This example highlights the importance of ordering of plugins in
# plugins.cfg during the compilation of CoreDNS.
#
# In the case where netbox was added before hosts requests will be handled
# by netbox exclusively and never by hosts, as netbox not set to fallthrough.
#
# Alternatively if netbox was added after hosts then requests that are not
# answered by hosts will fallthrough to netbox.

# The following example has requests in example.org handled by netbox:

#     url http://localhost:8000/api/ipam/ip-addresses

# The following has requests in example.org and example.net handled by netbox:
#
# . {
#   netbox example.org example.net {
#     token 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
#     url http://localhost:8000/api/ipam/ip-addresses

# }
#
# The following has all requests handled by netbox with fallthrough to forward.
#
# In addition all record from netbox will be set with a TTL of 1800 seconds.
#
# NOTE: Thix example assumes that netbox was added to plugin.cfg before
# forward.
