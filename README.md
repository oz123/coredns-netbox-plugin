# coredns-netbox-plugin

This plugin gets an A record from NetBox[1]. It uses the REST API of netbox
to ask for a an IP address of a hostname:

```
curl https://netbox.example.org/api/ipam/ip-addresses/?dns_name=example-vm-host

{
    "count": 1,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "family": {
                "value": 4,
                "label": "IPv4"
            },
            "address": "192.168.1.101/25",
            "interface": {
                "id": 452,
                "url": "https://netbox.example.org/api/virtualization/interfaces/452/",
                "virtual_machine": {
                    "url": "https://netbox.example.org/api/virtualization/virtual-machines/10/",
                },
            },
        }
    ]
}
```

## Enabling

To activate the *netbox* plugin you need to compile CoreDNS with the plugin added
to `plugin.cfg`

```
netbox:github.com/oz123/coredns-netbox-plugin
```

### Ordering in plugin.cfg

The ordering of plugins in the `plugin.cfg` file is important to ensure you
get the behaviour you expect when using multiple plugins in a
[Corefile server block][2].

For example, in order to utilise the native cache plugin, ensure that you add
the *netbox* plugin _after_ `cache:cache` but _before_ any plugins you want to
be able to fall-through to (eg `file:file` or `forward:forward`).

## Syntax

```
netbox [ZONES...] {
  token TOKEN
  url URL
  localCacheDuration DURATION
  ttl DURATION
  timeout DURATION
  fallthrough [ZONES...]
}
```

* **ZONES** zones that the *netbox* should be authoritative for.
* `token` **TOKEN** sets the API token used to authenticate against NetBox
  (**REQUIRED**).
* `url` **URL** defines the URL *netbox* should query. This URL must be
  specified in full as `SCHEME://HOST/api/ipam/ip-addresses` (**REQUIRED**).
* `localCacheDuration` **DURATION** sets the time to cache responses from
  NetBox.
* `ttl` **DURATION** defines the TTL of records returned from *netbox*. Default
  is 1h (3600s).
* `timeout` **DURATION** defines the HTTP timeout for API requests against
  NetBox. Default is 5s.
* `fallthrough` If a zone matches but no record can be generated, pass request
to the next plugin. If **[ZONESâ€¦]** is omitted, then fallthrough happens for
all zones for which the plugin is authoritative. If specific zones are listed
then only queries for those zones will be subject to fallthrough.

The config parameters `token`, `url` and `localCacheDuration` are required.

## Examples

Send all requests to NetBox:

```
. {
    netbox {
        token SuperSecretNetBoxAPIToken
        url https://netbox.example.org/api/ipam/ip-addresses
        localCacheDuration 300s
    }
}
```

Send requests within `example.org` to NetBox and fall-through to the `file`
plugin in order to respond to unsupported record types (ie `SOA`, `NS` etc):

```
. {
    netbox example.org {
        token SuperSecretNetBoxAPIToken
        url https://netbox.example.org/api/ipam/ip-addresses
        localCacheDuration 300s
        fallthrough
    }
    file db.example.org
}

```

Handle all requests with *netbox* and fall-through to the `forward`
plugin for requests within `example.org`:

```
. {
    netbox {
        token SuperSecretNetBoxAPIToken
        url https://netbox.example.org/api/ipam/ip-addresses
        localCacheDuration 300s
        fallthrough example.org
    }
    forward . 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
}
```

## Changelog

0.2 - Cleanup add IPv6 support
 
 * Refactor query.go
 * Add tests for IPv6
 * Enable IPv6 in ``query.go``

0.1 - Initial Naive release

 * Got it somehow working 
 * Gather feedback
## Developing locally

You can test the plugin functionallity with CoreDNS by adding the following to
`go.mod` in the source code directory of coredns.

```
replace github.com/oz123/coredns-netbox-plugin => <path-to-you-local-copy>/coredns-netbox-plugin
```

Testing against a remote instance of netbox is possible with SSH port forwarding:

```
Host YourHost
   Hostname 10.0.0.91
   ProxyJump YourJumpHost
   LocalForward 18443 192.168.1.128:8443
```

## Credits

This plugin is heavily based on the code of the redis-plugin for CoreDNS.
